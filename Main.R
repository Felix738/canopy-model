### Main

## This is the main script
## It runs all steps to carry out the simulation. This includes:
## 1. Loading packages, required functions, parameters, input data and initial state.
## 2. Initial calculations and definition of variables
## 3. Running a for loop that calculates fluxes and stocks over the simulation time
## 4. Writing out model output

# Required packages

# Required functions

# Load parameter file

# Load input

# Load initial state

# Model run (for loop)

# Write out output
